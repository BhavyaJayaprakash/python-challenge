PyBank Details: 

In this module, I have created a Python script to analyze the financial records of a companys financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Below steps of calculations are performed to achive the desired data:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The analysis is printed to the terminal and exported as a text file.
